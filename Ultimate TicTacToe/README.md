Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is an advanced version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where players compete to get three marks in a row on a 3x3 grid. However, in Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, the game is played on a larger 9x9 grid, consisting of nine individual 3x3 boards arranged in a similar structure.

The objective of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is to win three of the individual 3x3 boards in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each move a player makes determines which board the opponent will have to play on next. The strategy and decision-making in Ultimate Tic Tac Toe become more complex, as each move influences the game state as well as the subsequent moves available.
